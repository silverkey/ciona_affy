COLLECTION OF SCRIPTS TO BUILD A FLEXIBLE ANNOTATION MAPPING FOR CIONA INTESTINALIS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functional annotations mapping for the Ciona intestinalis transcriptome and proteome
are poor in public databases. This is specifically reflected in the lack of proper
annotations for the CINT06a520380F microarray. To our knowledge the best repository
for Ciona intestinalis functional annotations is the Aniseed database. Unfortunately
Aniseed data and sequences are separated in different files. Here we collected a
collection of scripts aimed at solving this lack unifyng the different gene models,
mapping all the probes of the microarray to the gene models and associating also
functional annotations inferred in the Anissed database by homologies searches.

In order to create the annotation file, the nucleotide sequences of probes are
retrieved from Affymetrix library file (CINT06a520380F.sif) while the transcript
models and annotations are downloaded from the ANISEED database:

1) JGI version 1,
2) KYOTOGRAIL2005,
3) KH
4) ENSEMBL.

Transcript models and annotations are parsed and joined together to form a unique
collection. Probeset sequences are then aligned against the collection of transcript
models by using BLAST+ (Camacho C. et al., 2009) with the megablast algorithm option.
Results are filtered in order to select exclusively hits with coverage >75% and
identity >90%. Based on the selected hits, we associated each probeset to the
corresponding transcript models and annotations. To perform such analysis. A MySQL
database containing all the information downloaded and generated is used to collect
and manage the data. This can be converted and made portable in an SQLite database
which can be queried to retrieve information for single probeset.

Order in which to run the script:

1) downoload_gene_models.sh
   downoload the different gene models, annotations and sequences from the aniseed webpage

2) join_models.pl
   parse the fasta and the annotations downloaded from aniseed
   produce the file aniseed_models.xls, aniseed_models_go.xls, aniseed_models_seq.xls,
   aniseed_models.fa

3) BLAST.sh
   run the blast of the affy probe .sit annotation against the transcripts models
   produce the blast db aniseed_models.blast and the blast result MEGABLAST_DEFAULT.out

4) parse_blast.pl
   parse the blast taking for each probeset the hits with coverage >75% and identity >90%
   produce the file ASSOCIATIONS_PROBE_ANISEED.xls

5) collate associations.pl
   join the association of the blast with the annotations
   produce the file PROBE_ANNOTATION.xls

6) create_and_populate_db.pl
   create a mysql database

7) converter.sh
   convert the mysql database in a sqlite database
   create the file ciona_affy_annotation.sqlite3
   ATTENTION: you have to change user and password into the script

8) create_summary.pl
   creates the tables with the annotations summarized by all the analysis.
   In the tables there is a row for each probe id. Tables are 2:
   - CIONA_AFFY_ANNOTATION_SUMMARY.xls
   - CIONA_AFFY_ANNOTATION_SUMMARY_SMALL.xls
   the only difference is that in the '_SMALL.xls' one you do not find the sequences of
   the matching gene models

9) query_probe.pl
   write in the terminal output all the information collected related to a single probe


THE ARCHIVE CIONA_AFFY_ANNOTATION_SUMMARY.tar.gz CONTAINS THE WHOLE OF THE ANNOTATIONS
GENERATED IN 2011 IN USEFUL TABLE THAT CAN BE EASILY VIEWED IN EXCEL AS WELL AS LOADED
IN DATABASES AND/OR IN OTHER SCRIPTS. TABLES HAVE THE .xls EXTENSION BUT THEY ARE REALLY
TAB DELIMITED TEXT DATA.


----------------
CinGOstat FOLDER
----------------
To execute GOstat-like analysis on lists of differentially expressed transcripts

Other files we use (TODO: to put the download of them into a script, at least the GO):

- CINT06a520380F.sif the file containing the sequences used by affy to design the probes.
  We modified it in CINT06a520380F_sif.fa in order to put it in fasta format for the blast
  to be used.

- GO table (GO.terms_alt_ids downoloaded from http://www.geneontology.org/doc/GO.terms_alt_ids)

Then in order to build the database we need the tables:
- PROBE_ANNOTATION.xls
- aniseed_models_go.xls
- aniseed_models_seq.xls
- GO.terms_alt_ids

You need to have everything in the same folder.

This are all the file we have at the beginning:

BLAST.sh
collate_associations.pl
download_gene_models.sh
ensembl.fa
jgi.ann
join_models.pl
kh.fa
kyotograil.fa
parse_blast.pl
CINT06a520380F_sif.fa
create_and_populate_db.pl
ensembl.ann
GO.terms_alt_ids
jgi.fa
kh.ann
kyotograil.ann
README

IN 2011 THE ANNOTATIONS TABLE HAVE ALREADY BEEN GENERATED AND ARE PRESENT
IN THESE FOLDERS. SO YOU DO NOT REALLY NEED TO RE-GENERATE THEM DE-NOVO.

A FILE WITH THE LIST OF SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES IS THE
ONLY THING YOU NEED TO RUN THE GOSTAT-LIKE ANALYSES. JUST EDIT THE R SCRIPT
AND PUT INTO THE SAME FOLDER:

- THE FILE WITH THE PROBE ID
- THE GO_array_annotation.txt FILE
- THE go_definition.txt FILE
