1) associate_GO_to_affy_id.pl

   Work in the database of the annotations and create
   a table associating at each probe id all the GO id
   associated in aniseed to the gene models eliminating
   the redundancies.

   Used to create the table GO_array_annotation.txt

2) parse_standard_go_table.pl
   
   Parse the official GO.terms_alt_ids table and write
   in output the GO id associated to the terms eliminating
   the column of the secondary GO id and adding them to the
   first column as primary.

   Used to create the table go_definition.txt

3) create_and_populate_go_definition_table.sql

   Insert the table created by parse_standard_go_table.pl
   into the annotation database for a better quering of the
   annotations, given that many GO id used in aniseed are
   taken by the secondary. TRY TO INTEGRATE THESE INTO
   THE SCRIPT THAT CREATE AND POPULATE THE DB!

   IT NEEDS THAT THE TABLE TO PUT INTO THE DB IS CALLED
   go_definition.txt

4) CinGOstat.R
   
   Once you have the 2 above files and a file with the
   probe id of the significantly differentially exspressed
   transcripts it runs GOstat!

   Write the table GO_significant.xls in output
